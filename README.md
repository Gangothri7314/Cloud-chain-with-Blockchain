## üìñ Abstract

Cloud computing provides scalable computation and storage at low cost, enabling users to store large amounts of data remotely and access it from anywhere. However, this comes with significant security risks. Since data is stored on third-party cloud servers, it can be vulnerable to unauthorized access or tampering, either by malicious actors or even internal employees.

Traditional encryption methods offer a level of protection but are not entirely foolproof due to risks of key compromise. To address these challenges, **Cloud Chain** integrates the power of **Ethereum Blockchain** and **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) with cloud services, ensuring secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data management.

## üîç Project Overview

**Cloud Chain** is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages:
- **Ethereum Blockchain** for secure and immutable record-keeping
- **IPFS** for decentralized file storage
- **Cloud-based frontend** to interface with users

### üí° How It Works

1. User uploads a file via the web interface.
2. The file is encrypted and stored on **IPFS**.
3. IPFS returns a **content hash (CID)** which uniquely identifies the file.
4. This CID is recorded on the **Ethereum Blockchain** via a **smart contract**.
5. During retrieval, the CID is fetched from the blockchain to retrieve the file securely.

### üõ° Why Blockchain?

- **Immutability:** Blockchain prevents unauthorized data modification using its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism and cryptographic hash verification.
- **Tamper Detection:** If any record is altered, the hash chain breaks, immediately signaling data tampering.
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates central points of failure or attack.
